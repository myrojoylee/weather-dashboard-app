# Weather Dashboard App

## Description

This application had several purposes: 1. To begin understanding how to work with server side APIs, 2. To understand how to isolate focused data from a large data retrieval, 3. To gain more experience in the interactivity of a web app through JavaScript, and 4. To further implement HTML and CSS skills into a practical application.

I learned how to use the fetch API in order to handle requests and responses from the OpenWeatherMap resource. No CSS framework was utilized in this assignment as a personal challenge to be able to apply CSS Flexbox and Grid to achieve an optimized responsive layout. I learned about Unix time and methods used by meteorologists to collect and display data.

## Usage

Below is an example of how a user would interact with this web application.
